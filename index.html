            <p>If you’ve ever written a program that works, there’s a pretty good chance that you’ve debugged a program
                before. Debugging is an integral part of the creation of every nontrivial program even for developers
                who have been writing code for many years. If you read
                <a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/way_of_the_program.html">Chapter 1</a>
                of How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, you will recall that there are three types of errors:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>syntax errors</li>
                <li>runtime errors</li>
                <li>semantic errors</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you don’t remember exactly what these mean, don’t worry; we’ll get more into that later. The idea to
                take away here is that, in the simplest sense, debugging is the process by which a programmer finds
                these errors and fixes them. There is no “correct” way to do this, but there are definitely some
                approaches that will be a lot more effective than others. This document is here to help you spend as
                little time debugging as possible so that you can spend more time writing code!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="section_header">My program raised an exception. What do I do?</div>
            <p>When your program raises an exception that you did not expect, it means you have either a syntax error
                or a runtime error. Don’t freak out! The great thing about these two types of errors is that the
                computer can usually tell you what’s wrong. Note that it can’t tell you how to fix it – that’s for
                you to figure out. You can never fix an error that you don’t understand (not easily, that is), which
                leads us to the most important step for fixing this situation:</p>
            <div class="emphasis">Read the error message</div>
            <p>Just seeing that there is red text is not enough. You need to look at what the red text says! There’s
                always some helpful information in there if you know how to find it. For one, the error message should
                be able to tell you what line the problem occurred. Keep in mind that sometimes you can encounter an
                error on one line which was caused on another line (this is especially possible for syntax errors).
                This means you may want to investigate the surrounding lines as well. In any case, having the line
                number can really narrow down your search for the error.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the error message will be able to tell you what it thinks went wrong. Check out the error
                reference to help determine what the error means. Error messages are written by other programmers just
                like you! They were meant to make sense, and you should definitely try to figure out what they’re
                trying to say.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="section_header">
                My program did not raise an exception, but it doesn’t do what I want it to do.
            </div>
            <p>This is a semantic error. Semantic errors are not fun to debug, because you don’t have a helpful error
                message to point you to the issue. You do, however, have an invaluable resource to help you find the
                problem: you! As the creator of the program, you are more equipped than anyone to figure out why the
                program isn’t functioning properly. This process definitely takes practice, but there are steps you
                can take to avoid semantic errors and then rid your program of them when they do occur.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Test tiny portions of your program often. You should not begin testing your program after
                        you finish writing it. Testing should take place with each few lines that you write just to
                        make sure it’s doing what you expect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Print statements are your friend. While there are many more robust debugging tools out there
                        that you will likely encounter in the future, you can probably debug every imaginable bug in
                        CS 1301 through the creative use of print. By printing variables at strategic points throughout
                        your program, you can usually get a pretty good idea of where the program went wrong.
