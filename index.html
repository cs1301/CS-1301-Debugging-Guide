                What is debugging?
            </div>
            <p>
	Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in a program. Don't worry if you have some errors, even professional programmers typically spend about half of their time finding and fixing errors. If you use a process of incremental development, and test your code as you develop it line by line you can reduce the amount of time that it takes to find errors, but most programs will have some errors inadvertently introduced and you will have to find and  fix them. 
                If you’ve ever written a program that works, there’s a pretty good chance that you’ve debugged a program before. Debugging is an integral part of the creation of every nontrivial program even for developers who have been writing code for many years. If you read
                <a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/way_of_the_program.html">Chapter 1</a>
                of How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, you will recall that there are three types of errors:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>syntax errors</li>
                <li>runtime errors</li>
                <li>semantic errors</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                If you don’t remember exactly what these mean, don’t worry; we’ll get more into that later. The idea to
                take away here is that, in the simplest sense, debugging is the process by which a programmer finds
                these errors and fixes them. There is no “correct” way to do this, but there are definitely some
                approaches that will be a lot more effective than others. This document is here to help you spend as
                little time debugging as possible so that you can spend more time writing code!

                Exceptions explained
            </div>
            <p>
                When your program raises an exception that you did not expect, it means you have either a syntax error
                or a runtime error. Don’t freak out! The great thing about these two types of errors is that the
                computer can usually tell you what’s wrong. Note that it can’t tell you how to fix it – that’s for
                you to figure out. You can never fix an error that you don’t understand (not easily, that is), which
                leads us to the most important step for fixing this situation:
            </p>
            <div class="emphasis">Read the error message</div>
            <p>
                Just seeing that there is red text is not enough. You need to look at what the red text says! There’s
                always some helpful information in there if you know how to find it. For one, the error message should
                be able to tell you what line the problem occurred. Keep in mind that sometimes you can encounter an
                error on one line which was caused on another line. This means you may want to investigate the
                surrounding lines as well. In any case, having the line number can really narrow down your search for
                the error.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, the error message will be able to tell you what it thinks went wrong. Check out the error
                reference to help determine what the error means. Error messages are written by other programmers just
                like you! They were meant to make sense, and you should definitely try to figure out what they’re
                trying to say.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                If your program did not raise an exception, but it doesn’t do what you want it to do, you have
                a semantic error. Semantic errors are not fun to debug, because you don’t have a helpful error
                message to point you to the issue. You do, however, have an invaluable resource to help you find the
                problem: you! As the creator of the program, you are more equipped than anyone to figure out why the
                program isn’t functioning properly. This process definitely takes practice, but there are steps you
                can take to avoid semantic errors and then rid your program of them when they do occur.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Test tiny portions of your program often. You should <b>not</b> begin testing your program after
                    you finish writing it. Testing should take place with each few lines that you write just to
                    make sure it’s doing what you expect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Print statements are your friend. While there are many more robust debugging tools out there
                    that you will likely encounter in the future, you can probably debug every imaginable bug in
                    CS 1301 through the creative use of print. By printing variables at strategic points throughout
                    your program, you can usually get a pretty good idea of where the program went wrong.

                Syntax errors practice
            </div>
            <p>
                Okay let’s try some debugging now. Syntax errors are definitely the easiest, since there are only a few
                you’ll regularly encounter. We’ll start there. Generally speaking, syntax errors occur when the
                program is formatted incorrectly in some way. Using the reference, try fixing this broken program:
            </p>
            <textarea class="coding_area" title=""></textarea>
            <textarea class="output_area" title=""></textarea>
            <div class="coding_buttons">
                <div class="reveal_solution coding_button" program="0">reveal solution</div>
                <div class="reset_program coding_button" program="0">reset</div>
                <div class="run_program coding_button" program="0">run</div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Ok that wasn't that hard! You may have noticed that the error you see here is a little different than
                what you would see in Calico. That’s because error messages are written by the creators of the compiler
                – this means they differ from language to language and from environment to environment. It would be
                impractical to try to memorize all the different types of errors, so it’s good to get into the habit
                of taking the time to understand them on a case by case basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let’s step it up a little. Here’s a really convoluted program that could really use some
                optimization. See if you can find the syntax error by using the error message:
            </p>
            <textarea class="coding_area" title=""></textarea>
            <textarea class="output_area" title=""></textarea>
            <div class="coding_buttons">
                <div class="reveal_solution coding_button" program="1">reveal solution</div>
                <div class="reset_program coding_button" program="1">reset</div>
                <div class="run_program coding_button" program="1">run</div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Woah! The line number was wrong!<br>
                <br>
                Kind of.<br>
                <br>
                While the extra parenthesis was on line 20, the error message gave us line 22, because that’s the first
                line to contain something other than what was expected. It turns out Python is pretty chill about line
                breaks in certain places. The line number in the error message got us to the right place, but keep in
                mind that the fix may have to take place elsewhere.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section interactive">
            <div class="section_header page_break">
                Runtime errors practice
            </div>
            <p>
                Runtime errors are a little bit trickier due to the sheer number of them that you can encounter.
                A runtime error occurs when your program is formatted correctly, but has a problem when it executes.
                Here are come common causes of runtime errors:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A variable was accessed that hasn’t been initiated</li>
                <li>A compound data type was indexed into a nonexistent position</li>
                <li>The incorrect number of parameters were used when calling a function</li>
                <li>A variable is used in the wrong context (e.g – as a string when it represents an int)</li>
                <li>An immutable datatype was treated like a mutable datatype </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Let's jump right into some examples! Check this one out:
            </p>
            <textarea class="coding_area" title=""></textarea>
            <textarea class="output_area" title=""></textarea>
            <div class="coding_buttons">
                <div class="reveal_solution coding_button" program="2">reveal solution</div>
                <div class="reset_program coding_button" program="2">reset</div>
                <div class="run_program coding_button" program="2">run</div>
            </div>
            <p>
                You’ll notice the error message here was actually pretty helpful. With most runtime errors, Python
                usually has a little bit more information for you as far as what caused the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here’s another example of a runtime error:
            </p>
            <textarea class="coding_area" title=""></textarea>
            <textarea class="output_area" title=""></textarea>
            <div class="coding_buttons">
                <div class="reveal_solution coding_button" program="3">reveal solution</div>
                <div class="reset_program coding_button" program="3">reset</div>
                <div class="run_program coding_button" program="3">run</div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Ah curveball! Here we had two issues at once. First, we were indexing into a string at a nonexistent
                position. Secondly, even if that worked, you can’t change the value of a string! You can only make a
                new string and store it in the same place. Both of these issues are very common runtime errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now for one more:
            </p>
            <textarea class="coding_area" title=""></textarea>
            <textarea class="output_area" title=""></textarea>
            <div class="coding_buttons">
                <div class="reveal_solution coding_button" program="4">reveal solution</div>
                <div class="reset_program coding_button" program="4">reset</div>
                <div class="run_program coding_button" program="4">run</div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Here we tried to take a string and combine it with an integer. Although this might make perfect sense
                to us given the context, Python wasn’t sure what to do. Should it result in a string or an int? In
                other words, Python has no way of knowing whether we wanted to add the string representation of the
                integer to the end of the string or if we wanted to add the integer value of the string to the integer.
                We received an error because of this ambiguity. Simply casting one of the elements is enough to make it
                clear which we prefer.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <div class="section_header page_break">
                Semantic errors practice
            </div>
            <p>
                Finally we have semantic errors. A semantic error exists any time your program runs to completion
                without raising an exception, but does not do what you want it to do. Another way of looking at
                this is that just because your program ‘works’ doesn’t mean it does what you want it to do! These are
                rarely easy to find because the problem could really be anywhere. Let’s ease into semantic errors with
                a simple example. You may have noticed that all of these functions have been printing Taylor Swift
                lyrics. Not this one though! See if you can figure out why:
            </p>
            <textarea class="coding_area" title=""></textarea>
            <textarea class="output_area" title=""></textarea>
            <div class="coding_buttons">
                <div class="hint coding_button" program="5">hint</div>
                <div class="reveal_solution coding_button" program="5">reveal solution</div>
                <div class="reset_program coding_button" program="5">reset</div>
                <div class="run_program coding_button" program="5">run</div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Not bad! It looks like the creator of the program might have just written the wrong variable name in
                the return statement. The takeaway here is that not all semantic errors are indicative of a major
                issue in your code. Sometimes it’s as simple as a typo in a return statement. Let’s take on a little
                more complicated example:
            </p>
            <textarea class="coding_area" title=""></textarea>
            <textarea class="output_area" title=""></textarea>
            <div class="coding_buttons">
                <div class="hint coding_button" program="6">hint</div>
                <div class="reveal_solution coding_button" program="6">reveal solution</div>
                <div class="reset_program coding_button" program="6">reset</div>
                <div class="run_program coding_button" program="6">run</div>
            </div>
            <p>
                This problem looks a little more complicated than a typo. In fact, it could be the result of the
                programmer not fully understanding how Python works. Indeed, in some languages this logic would work,
                but not in Python! Sometimes taking the time to understand how Python treats certain situations (like
                the scope of parameters) can go a long way in helping resolve semantic errors.
            </p>

                        This error does not correspond to any one scenario – it’s more of a general catch all for weird
                        situations. Check the error message to figure out exactly what happened. One example of a
                        runtime error is when you have a recursive function that never ends.

                    <td>
                        This rather annoying exception is raised when your program uses both tabs and spaces to
                        represent indentation. Some programs will default to inserting a specific number of spaces
                        when you press the tab key while others use the tab character (represented in a string like:
                        "\t"). When you use multiple programs to edit your code (or copy/paste between different
                        programs) you can sometimes get a mismatch. To fix this, try re-indenting the offending line(s)
                        with the same program that the rest of the code was written in.

                        There are a number of situations that can cause this, but the general idea is that you are
                        using the value of a variable in a way that it cannot be used. This can be anything from
                        concatenating a string with an integer, to trying to change a value in an immutable datatype.
